# Migration at Our Borders
Analyzed over 50,000 records of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection dataset on Nationwide Encounters from 2019-2022.  The current migrant crisis affects our country at all levels.  Many states have to provide shelter, food, and medical aid for the asylum seekers.  Title 42 ended on May 11th, and, as a result, our government expected a migrant influx. I wanted to see how Title 42 had affected the number of encounters and the results of these encounters.  With the data I also created a Tableau dashboard, and did a PowerPoint presentation for my Capstone Project on May 10th, 2023.  

# Analysis
Analyzed the dataset for:
- number of encounters from 2019-2022
- demographics most encountered
- nationalities most encountered
- resulting encounter types (apprehension/expulsion/inadmissible)
- The role Title 42 from March 2020 thru May 2023

# Tools
- Excel for data exploration
- Python for data cleaning and analysis
- Tableau for data visualization
- PowerPoint for presentation
  
# Data Findings
- Encounters greatly increased since 2020
- Most encounters were with single adults
- Most were of Mexican and Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) descendance
- Since the inception of Title 42 most encounters resulted in expulsion
